<h4>Customs and Cuisine of Pakistan</h4>
<span>THE FAMILY UNIT</span>
<p>
  The patriarchal, extended family is traditionally the norm.
  However, as with many regions around the world that are rapidly
  urbanizing, the nuclear family is becoming more common in the
  cities. While a patriarchal society, civil laws in Pakistan allow
  for women and female children the right of inheritance, alimony,
  child custody, and to work outside the home. In reality, these
  laws aren’t always adhered to and women tend to be more visible in
  traditionally female-oriented occupations such as homemakers,
  teachers, and nurses, but there a growing number of women are
  being appointed to office and law enforcement. The status of women
  in Pakistan varies depending on the location, ethnic group, and
  socio-economic group. It is a bit of a paradox that in this
  country, which was the first among Muslim countries to elect a
  female Prime Minister (Benazir Bhutto in 1988), forced child
  marriages, honor killings, marital rape being considered invalid,
  etc. are common, even in this age. The rise and fall, as it were,
  of the status of women in this country, seems to rest on who the
  head of the state/ruling party is at that given time period and
  their views on equality of the sexes. While its first few heads of
  state were extremely liberal and pro-feminism, those who followed
  were not. Confounding this is the disconnect between civil law and
  Sharia law, the latter being more restrictive and titled toward
  systematic gender-based discrimination. Since Pakistan’s
  constitution recognizes civil and Sharia law, the status of women
  is on balance, less equal than it would seem when only civil law
  is considered. The global gender inequality index ranks Pakistan
  at 121/157 countries. The female literacy rate has improved to
  45.8 percent (compared to 69.5 percent for males) but the female
  dropout rate remains high, especially in rural regions. Marriages
  are arranged along ethnic and kin lines, with marriages between
  first and second cousins being fairly common. Dowry is paid by the
  family of the bride to the groom and dowry-related violence and
  fatalities are one of the frequent causes of domestic violence
  against women. Children are considered a blessing, although male
  children are valued more than female children, and the arrival of
  a child in the family is greeted with pomp and festivities. The
  grandfather is considered a pivotal figure and child-naming rights
  often rest with him. The child naming ceremony is held 40 days
  after the birth and the child is addressed by a nickname until
  then.

<span>The Food of Pakistan</span>
<p>
  The history of the region, having been a part of and then cleaved
  out of colonial India, being on the ancient Silk Route, and its
  religious identity are what define Pakistani cuisine. Pork is
  forbidden under Islamic tenets, so the animal proteins of choice
  are lamb, mutton, chicken, beef, and fish. According to some
  reports, lamb, mutton, and beef are not sold on Tuesdays and
  Wednesdays, although the reasoning is rooted less in religion and
  more in commercial trade. The teachings of the Koran require meat
  to be “halal” (meaning that which is permissible) and that
  includes not only what kind of animal protein is permitted but the
  manner in which the animal is prepared for slaughter. The animal
  is not to suffer unnecessary cruelty during slaughter and the
  blood is to be drained. Of the many influences on its history and
  culture, the Indian and Mughal influences have been the most
  enduring and visible. Be it in the spices or the dishes (down to
  the name of the dish), the cuisine in Pakistan is in many ways
  identical to Indian cuisine or an amalgam of the cuisine from
  these two regions. As in Indian cuisine, many Pakistani dishes use
  a mix of spices commonly referred to as “karri,” which is a mix of
  ground dried turmeric root, red chili pepper or cayenne pepper,
  fenugreek seeds, and ground dried coriander seeds. Zira (Indian
  caraway seeds), black pepper, ginger, garlic, and saffron are also
  frequently used. Dishes that contain animal protein use cloves,
  cardamom, cinnamon, and nutmeg in addition to Karri. The Mughal
  influence is seen in the use of dried fruits and nuts in rice and
  vegetables dishes and the practice of grilling marinated meat on
  skewers. Pakistan can be broadly categorized into five provinces:
  Sindh (the southern coastal region), Balochistan (the southwestern
  province, also the largest), Punjab (the eastern province), Gilgit
  Baltistan (the northern province), and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (North
  West province). The access to seafood in the Sindh region allows
  for more seafood-based dishes in that province relative to the
  others which are landlocked. In the Punjab region, rotis (flat
  bread) are a staple. The Pathans of the Khyber Pakhtunkwa province
  consume lamb as a staple animal protein, as sheep are reared in
  that region. Sajji is a dish that is considered quintessentially
  Balochistan. It consists of lamb or chicken that has been stuffed
  with rice and rubbed with a spiced green papaya paste and then
  slow roasted for hours. Rice, wheat-based flatbread (roti,
  chappti, paratha, puri), lentils (dal), vegetables (sabzi),
  yogurt, and fruits (eaten with a dash of salt) are staples through
  out the country. The average Pakistani consumes three main meals;
  breakfast, lunch, and dinner. A very popular breakfast is Halva
  Puri. Puri is a fried flatbread and halva is a sweet paste made of
  sesame seeds, sugar syrup, and egg whites. Lunch and dinner
  consist of a carb (rice or a type of flatbread) with an animal or
  plant protein that has been stewed (meat stew or lentils or
  beans), vegetables, and yogurt. Some popular dishes are: Shabdeg:
  roughly translates to “the night boiler.” Mutton, beet, and turnip
  are simmered in a copper cauldron overnight to result in a thick
  stew. Aloo Ghosht: translates to “potatoes and meat.” Aloo
  (potatoes) and Ghosht (mutton or lamb) are cooked in a spicy
  tomato-based stew with ginger, garlic, and cinnamon. It is
  typically served hot with rice or paratha. Chapli Kebab/Peshawari
  Kebab: translates to “of Peshawar.” Traditional to Peshawar
  region, this kebab is made of ground beef and spices. Served with
  garnishes such as fresh parsley, diced tomatoes, and onions, it is
  a popular street food and a side dish at dinner. Sai Bhaji:
  translates to “green vegetables.” From the Sindh region, this
  vegan stew has a mix of seasonal greens such as spinach, gongura,
  and fenugreek leaves in a spiced lentil soup. Served over rice or
  with roti, it is a hearty yet healthy main dish. Nihari: Nahar =
  day. A hearty brunch dish typically consumed after morning
  prayers, this spicy stew is made by slow-braising lamb or beef
  overnight. Cuts of bone-in meat are used along with ginger,
  pepper, coriander powder, garam masala (an Indian spice mix), and
  lemon. The slow braising results in tender, fall-off the bone meat
  and an intensely flavorful, spicy stew. Haleem: a stew of meat and
  lentils spiced with coriander, fresh ginger, and chili peppers and
  garnished with fried onions and lemon. At festive occasions, pulao
  is often the star of the feast. A one-pot dish of spiced rice,
  vegetables such as carrots and peas, and animal protein such as
  mutton or chicken, it is served hot with a side of raitha (yogurt
  sauce). Biryani is another meat, vegetable, and rice dish that is
  served on festive occasions. Unlike pulao, for Biryani the
  components are cooked separately to a semi-done state. Rice is
  par-boiled, vegetables are steamed, and meat is sautéed, and then
  the components are layered in a pot and steamed until fully
  cooked. It is served topped with roasted nuts (cashews, slivers of
  almonds), dried fruits (raisins, apricots, etc.), and fried
  onions. Popular desserts are seviyaan (vermicelli pudding with
  pistachios and saffron), falooda (a layered milkshake of sorts
  made with ice cream, vermicelli, chia seeds, jelly, and rose
  water), kheer (rice pudding), gulab jamun (fried dough in syrup).
  Alcohol is forbidden in the Islamic faith, so chai (black tea
  leaves boiled in milk with nutmeg and sugar) is commonly consumed.
  During the summer months, cold beverages of choice are juice from
  sugarcane, “nimbu pani” (fresh lime juice), and lassi (sweet or
  savory yogurt drink).
